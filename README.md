# 🔮 QA Oracle: AI-Powered Requirements Analysis

An AI-powered analyzer for Software Requirements to identify ambiguities, contradictions, and risks before development begins. This project is built with a focus on accessibility and a *mobile-first* approach.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/qa-oraculo-requisitos.git
    cd qa-oraculo-requisitos
    ```
    > **Note:** Remember to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2.  **Run the setup script:**
    This command will create an isolated virtual environment (`.venv`) and install all the necessary dependencies.

    -   **For Windows (run in CMD or PowerShell):**
        ```bash
        setup.bat
        ```

    -   **For Mac or Linux (run in Terminal):**
        > First, give the script execution permission (you only need to do this once).
        ```bash
        chmod +x setup.sh
        ```
        > Now, run the script.
        ```bash
        ./setup.sh
        ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    After the setup is complete, you need to activate the environment to start working.

    -   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\.venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    -   **On Mac or Linux:**
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    > Your terminal prompt should now start with `(.venv)`, indicating that the environment is active.

## 🤔 Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to common issues you might encounter during setup.

### 1. `zsh: permission denied: ./setup.sh`

**Problem:** Your system is blocking the script from running for security reasons.

**Solution:** You need to give the script execution permissions. This only needs to be done once.
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
